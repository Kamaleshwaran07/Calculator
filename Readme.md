# Calculator

## HTML

I used table tags to display the buttons.

I also included the test suit app and the buttons.

## JavaScript 

I wrote the functions for clear, delete, equal so that it does its required use. 
and I also used keydown event with a condition of digits so that it actually does not respond to the alphabets and will alert for it

## CSS

I just didnt much focus on the styling part
